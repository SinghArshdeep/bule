Bule: A State of the Art CNF Grounder
=====================================

A refreshing new CNF grounder - combining features of Gringo and Sugar. The input will be some kind of similar logic
program as in Gringo - with support for pure clauses, implications, rules with completion semantics, cardinality and
weight constraints. The generated output wrt. to a groundable logic program will pure plain DIMACS CNF. This is a long
term project and I am just at the very beginning.  The grounder will be entierely programmed in GO!
