\section{Bule Syntax and Semantics}

Let $\Sigma,\Omega$ be disjoint countably infinite sets of relation
names. Each relation name $R\in \Sigma\cup\Omega$ has an associated
arity $\mn{ar}(R)$. Let us further fix a countably infinite supply of
constant symbols \mn{Con} and variable symbols $\mn{Var}$. An
\emph{atom} is of the form $R(t_1,\ldots,t_n)$ for some $R\in
\Sigma\cup\Omega$ and $t_1,\ldots,t_n\in\mn{Con}\cup\mn{Var}$ and
$n=\mn{ar}(R)$. An atom $R(t_1,\ldots,t_n)$ is \emph{ground} if
$t_1,\ldots,t_n\in\mn{Con}$; ground atoms are also called
\emph{facts}. An atom $R(t_1,\ldots,t_n)$ is a \emph{$\Sigma$-atom} or
an \emph{$\Omega$-atom} if $R\in \Sigma$ or $R\in \Omega$,
respectively. A \emph{literal} is an atom $R(t_1,\ldots,t_n)$ or a
negated atom $\neg R(t_1,\ldots,t_n)$.

A \emph{Bule knowledge base} is a pair $\Kmc=(\Dmc,\Pmc)$ where $\Dmc$ is a
finite set of facts and \Pmc is a set of rules of the form 
%
\[\alpha \Rightarrow L_1,\ldots,L_m\]
%
where $\alpha$ is a Boolean formula over $\Sigma$-atoms
and $L_1,\ldots,L_m$ are $\Omega$-literals such that every variable
that occurs in one of the $L_i$ does occur positively in
$\alpha$.\footnote{Here we would need the definition of the
  \emph{polarity} of a variable in a Boolean combination of
atoms.}\footnote{Why only clauses on the right-hand side?}
{\color{red}For simplicity, I don't use any syntactic sugar, that is,
%
\begin{itemize}

  \item no empty $\alpha$ as in the generating clauses
    $c(I,J),b(I,J)$,

  \item no integers as in $c(I,J),c(I+1,J)$ or $dom[1..k]$,

  \item no $[]$-atoms on the right-hand side, as in $edge[X,_]
    \Rightarrow node[X]$

\end{itemize}
Moreover, there are no rules of the form $[c(I)]:dom[I]$ yet. 
}

The semantics of Bule knowledge base $\Kmc=(\Dmc,\Pmc)$ is defined via
groundings. A \emph{substitution} is a map
$v:\mn{Var}\cup\mn{Con}\to\mn{Con}$ which is the identity on
$\mn{Con}$. For a Boolean combination of $\Sigma$-atoms $\alpha$ and a
substitution $v$, we define $\Dmc,v\models \alpha$ inductively as
follows follows: 
%
\begin{align*}
  %
%   \Dmc,v & \models \mn{true} \\
  %
  \Dmc,v & \models R(t_1,\ldots,t_n) && \text{if
  $R(v(t_1),\ldots,v(t_n))\in \Dmc$} \\
  %
  \Dmc, v& \models \neg \alpha && \text{if $\Dmc,v\not\models \alpha$}
  \\
  %
  \Dmc, v& \models \alpha \wedge \alpha' && \text{if $\Dmc,v\models
  \alpha$ and $\Dmc,v\models\alpha'$}
  %
\end{align*}
%
If $\Dmc,v\models\alpha$, we call $v$ a \emph{model} of $\alpha$.

Now, we assign a set of clauses $\mn{cl}(\Kmc)$ to the Bule knowledge
base $\Kmc=(\Dmc,\Pmc)$ as follows:
%
\[v(L_1)\vee\ldots\vee v(L_n)\in \mn{cl}(\Kmc)\]
%
whenever there is a rule $\alpha \Rightarrow L_1,\ldots,L_n\in\Pmc$ and $v$ is a
model of $\alpha$. Note that $\mn{cl}(\Kmc)$ is a set of clauses over
facts which we treat as propositional variables here.  We say that
$\Kmc$ is \emph{satisfiable} if the set of clauses $\mn{cl}(\Kmc)$ is
satisfiable.
