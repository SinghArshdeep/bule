\begin{abstract}
    Bule introduces the concept of QBF Programming - a paradigm that complements QBF solving with an intuitive modelling language. 
    The language is easy to learn and has a transparent grounding process that unrolls firt order term variables to a ground CNF formula with a quantifier prefix. 
%    Bule separates domain predicates for the grounding process and search variables syntactically. 
    The semantics of the language is strict and well-behaved and we complexity classes for both ground and non-ground programs. 
%    Our implementation can connect to any QBF solver and in case of only existential variables SAT solver. 
    Finally, Bule is a tool to learn QBF and SAT Programming due to its easy format and flexible integration with any QBF and SAT solvers. 
\end{abstract}

%% Motivation:

%% simpler and more strict, yet expressive enough. So it's more well-behaved and defined. 
%% This could lead solver developers to go for the actual non-ground specification of the problem. 
%% Orthogonal to this hierarchy is the hierarchy of quantifier levels. 
%% And a problem can be horn (max 1 positive literal per clause) or not. 
%% 
%% focus on grounding language (not fast grounder yet)
%% 
%% simpler and more strict: 
%% * non-recursive

\section{Introduction and Motivation}

To the best of our knowlede formal non-ground model languages are rare for SAT solving and not existing in QBF. 
For SAT there are modelling frameworks (cite PYSAT, Cite et). 
ASP - having a more difficult semantics - provides a non-ground modelling language GRINGO (cite).

We propose a modelling language for SAT and QBF solving with simpler syntax and semnatics than ASP.

%% \begin{abstract}
%%     SAT Programming extends SAT Solving by a declarative modelling language. 
%%     We propose Bule, a Logic Programming language, based on classical logic that introduces SAT Programming. 
%%     A ground program in Bule consist of a set of propositional clauses with meaningful literals. 
%%     The process of translating a non-ground program to propositional clauses is called grounding and is done by iterating over the domain of their variables. 
%%     The semantics of Bule is simpler than Answer Set Programming or First Order Logic with bounds.  
%%     Bule also offers techniques based on SAT Solving such as Approximate Model Counting and Quantified Boolean Formulae 
%%     and enriches such SAT related technologies by a uniform modelling language. 
%% \end{abstract}
%% 
%% \section{Introduction and Motivation}
%% 
%% Comparing Answer set programming and satisfiability solving. Key difference
%% according to \cite{Lierler17} is that ASP has a modelling language and a
%% grounder attached to it, whereas SAT is focused on problems stemming from
%% already ground problems. We will try to change that !
%% 
%% \section{Bule Syntax and Semantics}
%% 
%% \vale{has to be updated to the hierarchy}
%% For didactic reasons, we define syntax and semantics of \bule in three stages. 
%% We start with a fully ground program without term variables in \bflat, which is essentially CNF with readable literals. 
%% The non-ground language \bcore contains the basic functionality of the modelling language. 
%% Third we present the complete language \bfull, that allows for several extensions to ease modeling. 
%% 
%% \begin{itemize}
%%     \item \bflat: 
%%         \begin{itemize}
%%             \item Set of ground clauses with meaningful identifiers 
%%         \end{itemize}
%%     \item \bcore Non-ground language with clean semantics
%%         \begin{itemize}
%%             \item Syntax: Ground facts. Term variables (Capital letter) in generators that bind clauses. $::$
%%             \item fully bound (i.e. all variables are bound by a positive generator) 
%%             \item Exponential compression in the arity of the variables. 
%% 
%%                 p[X], p[Y] ::  q(X,Y). 
%%                 q(X,Y) : p[X] : p[Y].
%% 
%%         \end{itemize}
%%     \item \bfull 
%%         \begin{itemize}
%%             \item Grounding fact definitions. (Restriction: Induced graph is acyclic)
%%             \item All term variables are bound by a generator. 
%%             \item Negated generators allow if bound positively by other generator. 
%%             \item arithmetic (fully ground), exponential compression!
%%             \item Ranges, exponential compression!
%%         \end{itemize}
%%     \item \bnice is just for modelling and close to the implementation. 
%%         \begin{itemize}
%%             \item Implicitly bound variables, i.e. variables can be free. 
%%             \item Iterators (see the encoding for ATLEASTONE)
%%         \end{itemize}
%% \end{itemize}
%% 
%% \subsection{\bflat}
%% 
%% A ground Bule program is a set of clauses with literals. 
%% 
%% \subsection{\bcore}
%% 
%% Let $\Sigma,\Omega$ be disjoint countably infinite sets of relation symbols.  
%% Each relation symbol $R\in \Sigma\cup\Omega$ has an associated arity $\mn{ar}(R)$.  
%% Let us further fix a countably infinite supply of constant symbols \mn{Con} and variable symbols $\mn{Var}$.  
%% An \emph{atom} is of the form $R(t_1,\ldots,t_n)$ for some $R\in \Sigma\cup\Omega$ and $t_1,\ldots,t_n\in\mn{Con}\cup\mn{Var}$ and $n=\mn{ar}(R)$. 
%% An atom $R(t_1,\ldots,t_n)$ is \emph{ground} if $t_1,\ldots,t_n\in\mn{Con}$; ground atoms are also called \emph{facts}. 
%% An atom $R(t_1,\ldots,t_n)$ is a \emph{$\Sigma$-atom} or an \emph{$\Omega$-atom} if $R\in \Sigma$ or $R\in \Omega$, respectively. 
%% A \emph{literal} is an atom $R(t_1,\ldots,t_n)$ or a negated atom $\neg R(t_1,\ldots,t_n)$. 
%% An \emph{instance} is a finite set of facts. A \emph{substitution} is a map $v:\mn{Var}\cup\mn{Con}\to\mn{Con}$ which is the identity on $\mn{Con}$, that is, $v(a)=a$, for all $a\in\mn{Con}$.
%% et $\Imc$ be an instance, $\alpha$ a Boolean formula over atoms, and $v$ a substitution. 
%% 
%% We define $\Dmc,v\models \alpha$ inductively as follows: 
%% %
%% \begin{align*}
%%   %
%%   \Imc,v & \models R(t_1,\ldots,t_n) && \text{if
%%   $R(v(t_1),\ldots,v(t_n))\in \Imc$} \\
%%   %
%%   \Imc, v& \models \neg \alpha && \text{if $\Imc,v\not\models \alpha$}
%%   \\
%%   %
%%   \Imc, v& \models \alpha \wedge \alpha' && \text{if $\Imc,v\models
%%   \alpha$ and $\Imc,v\models\alpha'$}
%%   %
%% \end{align*}
%% %
%% If $\Imc,v\models\alpha$, we call $v$ a \emph{model} of $\alpha$ over the instance \Imc. 
%% A \emph{clause} is a disjunction of literals.
%% 
%% A \emph{\bcore-program} is a pair $\Pi=(\Imc,\Pmc)$ where $\Imc$ is a finite set of facts and \Pmc is a set of rules of the form 
%% %
%% \[B_1, \ldots, B_k :: L_1, \ldots, L_m\]
%% %
%% where $B_1,\ldots,B_k$ are $\Sigma$-atoms and $L_1,\ldots,L_m$ are $\Omega$-literals such that every variable that occurs in one of the $L_i$ does occur in one of the $B_i$.
%% 
%% The semantics of \bcore-programs $\Pi=(\Imc,\Pmc)$ is defined via groundings. 
%% More precisely, with every \bcore-program $\Pi=(\Imc,\Pmc)$, we associate a set $\mn{cl}(\Pi)$ of ground clauses as follows.  
%% For every rule $B_1,\ldots,B_k :: L_1,\ldots, L_n\in\Pmc$ and every model $v$ of $B_1\wedge\ldots\wedge B_k$ in \Imc, $\mn{cl}(\Pi)$ contains the clause
%% %
%% \[v(L_1)\vee\ldots\vee v(L_n).\]
%% %
%% We say that $\Pi$ is \emph{satisfiable} if the set of clauses $\mn{cl}(\Pi)$ is satisfiable, that is, 
%% there is an instance $\Mmc$ such that $\Mmc,\emptyset \models\mn{cl}(\Pi)$ (note that $\mn{cl}(\Pi)$ is ground, so the empty substitution $\emptyset$ suffices).
%% 
%% {\color{red} Although \bcore is a relatively simple language, we can
%% already model natural problems with it. To distinguish $\Sigma$- and
%% $\Omega$-atoms we write them with parenthesis $p(\;\;\cdot)$ or brackets
%% $q[\;\;\cdot]$,
%% respectively.
%% 
%% 
%% %\begin{example}
%% %  
%% %\end{example}
%% 
%% }
%% 
%% 
%% \subsection{\bfull}
%% 
%% We extend \bcore with \emph{extended instances}, \emph{iterators},
%% \emph{integers}, and \emph{implicit declarations} and define the
%% semantics by mapping to \bcore. We start with definitions. 
%% 
%% An \emph{extended instance \Jmc} is a union of an instance \Imc with a
%% a set of rules of the form
%% %
%% \[B_1,\ldots,B_k\rightarrow B\]
%% %
%% where $B,B_1,\ldots,B_k$ are $\Sigma$-atoms and every variable that
%% occurs in $B$ occurs in one of the $B_i$. We further require that the
%% rules in \Jmc are acyclic in the sense that the graph $G_\Jmc = (V_\Jmc,E_\Jmc)$ is
%% acyclic, where $V_\Jmc$ is the set of all relation symbols that occur in
%% \Jmc and $(R,R')\in E_\Jmc$ if there is a rule
%% $B_1,\ldots,B_k\rightarrow B$ where $B$ is an atom with relation
%% symbol $R'$ and some $B_i$ is an atom with relation symbol $R(\cdot)$.  
%% 
%% An extended \bcore-program is now a pair $\Pi=(\Jmc,\Pmc)$ where
%% $\Jmc$ is an extended instance and \Pmc a set of rules as above. Every
%% extended \bcore-program \emph{induces} a \bcore-program $(\Imc,\Pmc)$
%% via an inductive process as follows. Let $\Imc_0$ be the set of facts
%% in \Jmc, and define $\Imc_{i+1}$ from $\Imc_i$ by adding, for every
%% rule $B_1,\ldots,B_k\rightarrow B\in \Jmc$ and every model $v$ of
%% $B_1\wedge \ldots \wedge B_k$ over $\Imc_i$, the fact $v(B)$ to
%% $\Imc_{i+1}$. Note that this process terminates due to acyclicity of
%% \Jmc; $\Imc$ is defined to be fixed point of the sequence $\Imc_n$. An
%% extended \bcore-program is satisfiable if the induced \bcore-program
%% is satisfiable. 
%% 
%% Extended \bcore-programs can be used to define auxiliary facts which
%% are often useful for modeling, e.g.~see the following example. 
%% %
%% \begin{example}
%%   %
%%   \textcolor{red}{TODO.}
%%   %
%% \end{example}
%% 
%% 
%% \subsection{\bnice}
%% 
%% To make it easier to define the semantics of \bfull we omitted the syntactic sugar. 
%% The language \bnice on the other hand contains all syntactic sugar and makes modelling very convenient.  
%% Features like: 
%% 
%% \begin{itemize}
%%   \item iterators of the form $c(I):dom[I]$
%%   \item ranges $dom[1..k]$ 
%%   \item implicit definition of term variables as in the clause $~c(I,J),b(I,J).$.
%%   \item simple arithmetic as in the rule $c(I,J),c(I+1,J).$ 
%%   \item more arithmetic as in the rule $ I== 0 \ldots Y^2, k[K] :: c(I^K\%2).$
%% \end{itemize}

%% \vale{Program transformations. Multiple stages of grounding. Conceptual algorithm with some states.}
%% 
%% \section{Application}
%% 
%% \subsection{$4x4$ NQueens as \bflat}
%% 
%% Flat Bule only contains grounded clauses. It's essentially a pretty print of CNF.
%% 
%% \lstinputlisting{programs/queens_flat.bul}
%% 
%% \subsection{Simplified $4x4$ NQueens as \bcore}
%% 
%% Only vertical and horizontal constraints.
%% 
%% \lstinputlisting{programs/queens_core.bul}
%% 
%% \subsection{Generic NQueens in \bfull}
%% 
%% \lstinputlisting{programs/queens_full.bul}
%% 
%% Completing a setup of non-attackig queens on a chess board is infact NP-Complete (proven in 2017 \cite{Gent17}).
%% 
%% \subsection{Reachability}
%% 
%% Given a set of edges, the following program encodes reachability in the induced graph, i.e. 
%% 
%% \lstinputlisting{programs/reachability/reachability.bul}
%% 
%% \subsection{s-t Connectivity via Savitch}
%% 
%% \subsection{Cardinality Encoding}
%% 
%% Bule does not provide native cardinality constraints. 
%% There is plenty of literature on how to efficiently encode such constraints to CNF maintaining good properties. 
%% We show the \emph{counter} encoding based on \cite{Sinz05} in \bnice syntax.
%% Assume that the variables $element(1\ldots n)$ are already defined, as well as 
%% the auxiliary variables $count(I,J)$. 
%% The encoding consists of 4 different types of clauses: 
%% 
%% \lstinputlisting{programs/counter.bul}
%% 
%% Variations of this encoding can express other types of cardinality.
%% If the second last unit is omitted, the clause set defines an AtMost constraint ( respectively the last unit an AtLeast constraint). 
%% For $k=1$ the counter encoding comes down to the ladder encoding (cite Ian Gent). 
%% 
%% \subsection{Planning Problem}
%% 
%% Find a good planning problems. 
%% Sokoban might be too complicated. 
%% Is there a simpler one ? 
%% 
%% \subsection{Prime Game: QBF}
%% 
%% Here we show that Bule can be used to model PSPACE complete problems in QBF. 
%% We also show how to do LOG encoding.  
%% 
%% Two players choosing the bits of a 5 bit number from lowest to highest bit such that 
%% the second player wins if the number is prime and the first if it is not. 
%% 
%% We apply the adaptive LOG encoding here such that. This encoding translates
%% naturally to Bule. We introduce a generator fact {\verb bit(D,I,P)} that is the 
%% bit representation of the  number $D$ with the $I$s bit to 1 (resp. 0). 
%% 
%% \lstinputlisting{programs/prime.bul}
%% 
%% \subsection{Synthesis: Unit Propagation Complete}
%% 
%% Boolean function synthesis is a common application of QBF.
%% For SAT programming one of the quality aspect of the CNF decomposition is the strenght of unit propagation on any partial assignment. 
%% In this section we show how to encode whether a concrete CNF formula is unit propagation complete (UPC), i.e. UP detects inconsistencies on any partial assignment (citation needed).  
%% For this we program a kind of meta reasoning, which demonstrates the power of QBF. 
%% 
%% \lstinputlisting{programs/gac.bul}
%% 
%% \subsection{Approx Model Counting}
%% 
%% Find a cool probability problem where we define two SAT problems. 
%% One for the nominator, one for the denominator. 
%% 
%% \section{Complexity}
%% 
%% \abd{Analyse} and \jean{check}. 
%% 
%% In Table \ref{tab:complexity} we give an overview of the complexity classes
%% that each fragment of is complete for. The proof follows from the reduction of
