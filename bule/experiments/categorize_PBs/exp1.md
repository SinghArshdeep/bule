Categorize PBs in the PB competition
====================================

We run bule to characterize all constraints into useful categories. 
According to the results we will split up the instances into useful, i.e. 
a benchmark that contains a variety of complex PBs together with AMO/EX1 such 
that we can apply our advanced techniques.
