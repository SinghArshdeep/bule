The SAT Programming Framework Bule
=================================

Bule is a tool to create beautiful CNF encodings.
Bule is a sophisticated grounder for the modelling language Bule that translates to CNF for SAT Solving. 
Bule provides a front end for various SAT technologies. 


Features
--------

* Grounding of the declarative modelling language Bule. 
* satisfiability solving - allowing any number of SAT solvers to be called with the grounded CNF formula
* debugging facilities for CNF formulas, statistics on size and quality 
* QBF solving
* Model Counting and Approximate model counting. 
* Various encodings for cardinality constraints and Pseudo Boolean constaints. 

### Constraints to SAT translations: 

* Multiple cardinality encodings
* Full Pseudo Boolean Translations to CNF
